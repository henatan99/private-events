# Private Events 

## About 

In this project, we build an application named Private Events and that behaves similar to Eventbrite. The main goal is to put in practice the main concepts of Associations in rails.The app allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. For this, many-to-many model relationships is implemented.
